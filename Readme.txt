INPUT PARAMETERS: 
- Grain Size: 
Options: 40, 80, 138, 179, 211, 269.

A file containing a set of the 3-Parameter Lognormal distribution approximation of the samples must be used. A set of files is included according to the grain sizes required.

The files are:
3_p_lognormal_input_data_size_40
3_p_lognormal_input_data_size_80
3_p_lognormal_input_data_size_138
3_p_lognormal_input_data_size_179
3_p_lognormal_input_data_size_211
3_p_lognormal_input_data_size_269

A Python Script is included in order to generate the 3-Parameter Lognormal distribution with other statistical properties.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUTS: 
A set of 50 files are generated in each execution of the script.

For the selected grain size, 10 files are obtained by each size "N". With N=3,4,5,10,20. Also, the value of "N" can be changed in the script.

The format of the output file is: 


Bricklayer_model_[Grain Size]_[N]_[iteration].cir


The file must be analyzed using any version of PSpice software. And, depending on the iteration value, the value of N is defined by:
- Iteration  1 to 10: N=3.
- Iteration 11 to 20: N=4.
- Iteration 21 to 30: N=5.
- Iteration 31 to 40: N=10.
- Iteration 41 to 50: N=20.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The stages of the script are:

Stage 1: For each grain size, the statistical parameters are assigned:
- For the resistors "R" : the lognormal parameters "mu" and "sigma" are assigned.
- For the Capacitors "C" : A vector of 100.000 elements is generated by the file which contains a samples of noise with the statitiscal properties required by each grain size. 


Stage 2: 10 models of each matrix size "N" are generated:
- Iteration  1 to 10: N=3.
- Iteration 11 to 20: N=4.
- Iteration 21 to 30: N=5.
- Iteration 31 to 40: N=10.
- Iteration 41 to 50: N=20.

Stage 3: A bricklayer model is generated according to the value of "N" selected.   


Stage 4: The values of each resistor are obtained using the lognrnd() function of MatLab, and "mu" and "sigma" parameters of each grain size.
The values of each capacitor are obtained from the vector generated in Stage 1.
Although, the resistance and capacitance are included in a new vector as the real and complex part respectively, they will be considered as separated components.

Stage 5: 
The corresponding values of each resistor and capacitor are assigned to each element of the bricklayer model generated in Stage 3.
tage 5: 
 

Stage 6: A PSPice "*.cir" file is generated for each iteration.
